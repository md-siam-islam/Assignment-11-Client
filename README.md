## Purpose :

        This website is a book library. First, you need to
        log in to the website
        otherwise, you won’t be able to perform any actions.
        On this website, you can add books of your choice from
        the "Add Book" section. You will be able to view the books
        you’ve added in the "All Books" section.

        If you want to update a book you’ve added, you can do so by 
        clicking the "Update" button. To borrow a book, you need to
        select the book’s category first. This website has four
        categories, and clicking on your desired category will display
        all the books under that category.

        Once you find the book you need, click on it and then click the 
        "Borrow" button to add it to the "Borrow Section." When borrowing 
        a book, you must set a return date. If the book’s quantity is 0, 
        you won’t be able to borrow it.

        You cannot borrow a book again unless you return the one you’ve
        already borrowed. The books you add can only be viewed by you;
        others won’t have access to them.
